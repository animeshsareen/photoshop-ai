# FreeEdit Sub-Section Editing Feature Implementation

## 1. Frontend Implementation

### 1.1 Image Interaction Layer
- Add a clickable overlay icon on uploaded images (e.g., a small pencil or edit icon).  
- On click, activate the “sub-section editing mode”:  
  - Display a semi-transparent toolbar for drawing tools.  
  - Overlay a canvas or SVG element on top of the image for drawing shapes and freehand strokes.  

### 1.2 Drawing Tools
- Shapes: Rectangle, circle, ellipse, polygon.  
- Free Brush: Smooth line drawing with configurable brush size and color.  
- Selection Logic: Allow users to select, move, resize, and delete drawn shapes.  
- Implement an undo/redo stack for all drawing actions.  

### 1.3 UI/UX
- Toolbar should be floating near the image but not obstructing it.  
- Include “Confirm” and “Cancel” buttons for the sub-section selection.  
- Highlight the active area during editing with a semi-transparent overlay to distinguish the editable region.  

### 1.4 Responsiveness
- Ensure drawing and selection works across desktop and mobile devices.  
- Support pinch-to-zoom for precision editing on mobile.

## 2. Backend Considerations

### 2.1 Image Handling
- When a sub-section is selected, store coordinates and masks on the server.  
- Ensure the original image remains unaltered; apply edits on a copy.  

### 2.2 API Endpoints
- **POST /image/subsection**: Send selected region coordinates, mask, or edited overlay.  
- **GET /image/subsection**: Fetch previously edited masks for re-editing.  

### 2.3 Storage
- Save masks or vector overlays (SVG/JSON) alongside the original image.  
- Store metadata for shapes and brush strokes to allow re-editing without loss of fidelity.

## 3. Integration with FreeEdit
- Modify FreeEdit processing to:  
  - Detect if a sub-section is selected.  
  - Apply edits only to the selected region.  
  - Ensure the rest of the image remains intact.  
  - Optionally, provide blending options to smoothly integrate edited section with the original.

## 4. Libraries/Tools
- Frontend: `react-canvas-draw`, `react-konva`, or `fabric.js` for interactive drawing.  
- Backend: Node.js/Next.js API routes for saving masks and image processing.  
- Optional: `sharp` or `jimp` for server-side image cropping and processing.

## 5. Testing & QA
- Verify drawing tools work accurately across image sizes.  
- Test sub-section edits with FreeEdit to ensure only selected area is modified.  
- Ensure undo/redo, cancel, and confirm actions behave correctly.  
- Validate performance for high-resolution images.
